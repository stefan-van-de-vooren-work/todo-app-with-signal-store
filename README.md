## Run tasks

To run the dev server for your app, use:

```sh
npx nx serve todo-app
```

To create a production bundle:

```sh
npx nx build todo-app
```

To see all available targets to run for a project, run:

```sh
npx nx show project todo-app
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.
